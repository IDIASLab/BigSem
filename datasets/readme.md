Two real–world datasets that will be used in module 3 during the tutorial:

1. **Linked Movie Database (LMDB):** An openly accessible knowledge graph of facts about 38,000 movies (including title, runtime, actors, genres, producers, and country of origin). Sourced from from Hassanzadeh, Oktie and Mariano P. Consens. “Linked Movie Data Base.” LDOW (2009).

2. **[RecipeKG](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/99PNJ5):** Contains facts about recipes, their ingredients, the cuisine they belong to, and nutritional information. This includes a small portion of the dataset, sufficient for our hands-on tutorial, but you can access the full dataset on [Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/99PNJ5) or [GitHub](https://github.com/IDIASLab/RecipeKG).
