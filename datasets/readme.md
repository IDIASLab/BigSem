Two realâ€“world datasets will be used during the tutorial:

1. **Linked Movie Database (LMDB):** An openly accessible knowledge graph of facts about 38,000 movies (including title, runtime, actors, genres, producers, and country of origin).

2. **[RecipeKG](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/99PNJ5):** Contains facts about recipes and their ingredients, the cuisine they belong to, and nutritional information.
